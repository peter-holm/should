Changes from 1.0.-5 to 1.0.-4:

* Added a mask of allowed operations to allow_unix and allow_tcp so that
  users can be given limited control. They also check for duplicate users,
  and merge all the permissions together. Likewise, disallow_unix and
  disallow_tcp remove permissions from an existing user, and remove the
  whole user if no permissions are left.

* Allowed quoting in commands (tunnel and remote_should) so that components
  can have spaces.

* printconfig and serverconfig now mask out passwords (they appear as "*").

* documentation changes to match all the above.

* added an "external_copy" command to use when the program needs to copy
  file data; this is for people who demand to use rsync. Unfortunately,
  rsync doesn't cooperate: one needs to call rsync once per file, because
  asking it to take a list from standard input results in rsync waiting
  until should exits to start the transfer; and giving the files on the
  rsync's command line means that we need to call it once per copy event.
  The problem with the list on standard input is not caused by stdio
  buffering, because it happens even if we send the file name 1000000 times
  for each file to copy, and buffers aren't that big. It's clearly rsync
  buffering the whole list before starting (this happens with rsync 3.0.6).
  We may try with librsync, but not in this release.

* when a new watch is added automatically (after a create directory event),
  now check for excludes and crossmount to avoid adding subdirectories we
  do not really want to add.

* added [dis]allow_local as alias for [dis]allow_unix.

* allowing "listen=:port" as a shorthand for "listen=0.0.0.0:port" plus
  "listen=[::]:port".

* added "host=" to allow_tcp and "socket=" to allow_unix to specify
  where one can connect from.

* moved some code from the store to the notify thread for better handling
  of recursive descent into subdirectories.

* extensive changes to config.c which have not much to do with "should" but
  rather to the fact that I am using the same config.c in several packages.
  One day it'll be split out as a separate library.

* added special names "info", "warn" (or "warning"), "err" (or "error"),
  "crit" (or "critical") to the "report" option so groups of messages can
  be redirected with just one option.

* in 1.0.-5 some operations may try to use information from a configuration
  which no longer exists (due to an update); this has been fixed in 1.0.-4.

* in 1.0.-5 one could update error messages and destination on a running
  server, then roll back, and the changes would still be committed; this
  has been fixed in 1.0.-4.

* changed error reporting on commands to make it clearer. Some more work
  will be needed there.

* other bug fixes.
