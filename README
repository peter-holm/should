Should 1.0.-4

Before installing "should", it is strongly recommended to install
the openssl library together with the corresponding development
package, if required.

To check if openssl is installed and usable, run ./configure --
and check that the following line is NOT produced:

    WARNING: TCP connections require openssl

Also, check that a notify model could be found by making sure the
following line is NOT produced:

    WARNING: No notification model found, building client only

These are warnings only because it may be useful to build the program
without the corresponding functionality. But usually you do want it.

Other libraries are recommended. Check for the following lines in
the output of ./configure:

    Checking for libz... Found
    Checking for libbz2... Found

If either says "Not found", you may want to install them and re-run
./configure -- they are not necessary, however compression of network
traffic requires at least one of these.

Once you are happy with the result of ./configure, look at the Site.make
file for any additional configuration (if you want to install into /usr/local
and your system looks "normal" you don't need to do this). Then type:

    make
    make install
